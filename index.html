        <h3>ATTENTION POTENTIAL ASSET:</h3>
        <p>This message will self-destruct in 5... 4... 3... (just kidding, we're not that advanced yet. Or are we? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Are you tired of your boring 9-to-5 job? Do you dream of a life filled with intrigue, danger, and the constant fear of polygraph tests? Look no further! International Mirrors is recruiting*.</p>

    <h2>Coming Soon: The Ultimate Spy Simulation</h2>

    <p>Dive into the world of espionage without the risk of actual treason! Our state-of-the-art AI will generate thrilling scenarios that will test your wit, cunning, and ability to keep track of elaborate lies. It's like social media, but with more fake identities!</p>

    <h3>Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Recruit assets (or become one - we don't judge, but our AI might)</li>
        <li>Master the art of doublespeak (and triple-speak for overachievers)</li>
        <li>Enjoy paranoia-inducing gameplay (now with 50% more paranoia!)</li>
        <li>Learn to trust no one, not even yourself (especially not yourself)</li>
        <li>Decipher cryptic messages (like "Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to pick up milk on your way home")</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span class="warning-highlight">Warning</span>: Side effects may include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Constantly looking over your shoulder (great for neck exercises!)</li>
        <li>Sudden urges to wear trench coats (even in summer)</li>
        <li>Developing a taste for shaken, not stirred martinis (and an inexplicable British accent)</li>
        <li>Uncontrollable desire to speak in code ("The eagle has landed" now means "I've ordered pizza")</li>
        <li>Suspicion that your pet might be a double agent (Sorry, Mr. Whiskers, but we're onto you)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="highlight"><small>*Recruitment not guaranteed. Must pass rigorous background check (or be really good at faking one). Ability to rock a tuxedo/evening gown while diffusing bombs is a plus.</small></p>

    <p>Remember: In the world of espionage, the only thing certain is uncertainty. And taxes. Spies still have to pay taxes. (Even on their secret island lairs)</p>

        <h3>Top Secret: The AI Behind the Curtain</h3>
        <p>Warning: Classified Information Ahead</p>
        <p>In the spirit of transparency (a foreign concept in espionage), we must disclose that 95% of this page, including its wit and charm, was crafted by an AI agent codenamed <a href="https://www.anthropic.com" class="claude-link">"Claude"</a>. Yes, even AIs are getting in on the espionage game now. Humans are slowly being replaced by machines, but you didn't hear that from us. ü§ñüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
        <p>Remember: In the world of AI-assisted espionage, the lines between human and machine intelligence are blurrier than ever. Stay vigilant, and always check your toaster for hidden microphones.</p>
