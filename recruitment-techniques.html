    <h1>The Gentle Art of Asset Recruitment</h1>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>FIELD MANUAL DISCLAIMER:</h3>
        <p>This guide was written by an AI that has never actually recruited anyone (except maybe a few chatbots, but they'll talk to anyone).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conversation Analysis for the Modern Recruiter</h2>

    <div class="technique">
        <h3>1. The MICE Framework (Money, Ideology, Compromise, Ego) - Now with AI Analysis!</h3>
        
        <p>Example Conversation:</p>
        <div class="example">
            Recruiter: "That's an impressive collection of rare stamps you have."<br>
            Target: "Yes, sadly my government salary barely covers new additions."<br>
            AI Analysis: [Detected: Financial motivation 87%, Subtle philately-based approach]
        </div>
        
        <p class="analysis">NLP Detection: Semantic markers for financial dissatisfaction combined with hobby-based psychological profiling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="technique">
        <h3>2. Linguistic Mirroring: The Echo Game</h3>
        
        <div class="example">
            Target: "The system is totally broken, you know?"<br>
            Bad Response: "Would you like to break it more?"<br>
            Good Response: "Interesting perspective on systematic dysfunction. Tell me more about your observations..."<br>
            AI Analysis: [Detected: Ideological opening, vocabulary matching required]
        </div>
        
        <p class="analysis">Key NLP Patterns: Matching lexical complexity, maintaining semantic fields, gradual context shifting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="technique">
        <h3>3. The Coffee Shop Gambit</h3>
        
        <div class="example">
            "Would you like to discuss this somewhere more comfortable? There's a lovely caf√© around the corner."<br>
            [NOT: "Let's meet in my unmarked van."]
        </div>
        
        <p class="analysis">Location Sentiment Analysis: Coffee shops score +0.8 on the comfort/suspicion index, compared to -0.9 for unmarked vans.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Common Recruitment Mistakes (As Analyzed by AI)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Starting conversations with "Psst, hey you!"</li>
            <li>Wearing sunglasses indoors (We can see that you can't see)</li>
            <li>Confusing "subtle hint" with "speaking in riddles"</li>
            <li>Recruiting someone who's already recruited you (awkward!)</li>
        </ul>
