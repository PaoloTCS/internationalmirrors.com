    <p><strong>EYES ONLY</strong>: This document will self-destruct after reading. (Just kidding, it's the internet. Nothing ever really goes away.)</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Section 1: What We Know About You</h2>
        <p>We know you're interested in espionage, have questionable decision-making skills, and probably look great in a trench coat. Beyond that, we collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your email address (obviously)</li>
            <li>The number of times you've watched James Bond movies (we're guessing... a lot)</li>
            <li>Your preferred shaken-not-stirred beverage</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Add the rest of the sections here, following the same structure -->

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Section 7: Contact Us</h2>
        <p>To contact us, simply speak your message aloud in an empty room. We'll get back to you via a cryptic message in tomorrow's newspaper classifieds.</p>
    </div>

    <p>By using our site, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, well, this message will self-destruct in 5... 4... 3...</p>
